In today's video, I'm gonna be talking about YC and why it is the best startup accelerator in 2025.

2
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:14,150
YC has been around since 2005, setting the bar high for launching startups.

3
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:22,100
They have backed startups like Airbnb, Reddit, OpenAI, yeahhh, those.

4
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:25,090
So what makes YC special?

5
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:28,680
1. Mentorship from real founders.

6
00:00:28,681 --> 00:00:33,981
2. The $500,000 upfront

7
00:00:33,982 --> 00:00:39,782
3. The networking. Thousands of founders trying to help each other.

8
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:47,920
I first discovered YC in 2022, and since that day, my perception about building startups has completely changed.

9
00:00:47,921 --> 00:01:03,949
Now, I'm even applying with my own startup, Wands. It's an AI-powered video editing agent, which means that can edit the video for you. You send the video, it's gonna be edited in like one, two minutes, no more.
