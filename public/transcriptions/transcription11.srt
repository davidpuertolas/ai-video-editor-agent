In today's video, I'm gonna be talking about YC and why it is the best startup accelerator in 2025.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,400
YC has been around since 2005, setting the bar high for launching startups.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
They have backed startups like Airbnb, Reddit, OpenAI, yeah, those.

5
00:00:33,511 --> 00:00:36,500
So what makes YC special?

6
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:43,100
1. Mentorship from real founders.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,300
2. The $500,000 upfront, no fluff.

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:02,000
3. The networking. Thousands of founders trying to help each other.

10
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:47,643
I first discovered YC in 2022, and since that day, my perception about building startups has completely changed.

11
00:01:49,972 --> 00:02:06,000
Now, I'm even applying with my own startup, Wands. It's an AI-powered video editing agent, which means that can edit the video for you. You send the video, it's gonna be edited in like one, two minutes, no more.
