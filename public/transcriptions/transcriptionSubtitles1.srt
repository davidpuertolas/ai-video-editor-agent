In today's video, I'm gonna be talking about YC and why it is the best startup accelerator in 2025.

2
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:17,900
YC has been around since 2005, setting the bar high for launching startups.

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:27,500
They have backed startups like Airbnb, Reddit, OpenAI, yeah, those.

4
00:00:31,011 --> 00:00:34,000
So what makes YC special?

5
00:00:37,011 --> 00:00:40,600
1. Mentorship from real founders.

6
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:47,800
2. The $500,000 upfront, no fluff.

7
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,500
3. The networking. Thousands of founders trying to help each other.

8
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:13,343
I first discovered YC in 2022, and since that day, my perception about building startups has completely changed.

9
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:31,700
Now, I'm even applying with my own startup, Wands. It's an AI-powered video editing agent, which means that can edit the video for you. You send the video, it's gonna be edited in like one, two minutes, no more.
