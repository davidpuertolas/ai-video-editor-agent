## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/wands-demo.git
cd wands-demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## Features

- ‚úÇÔ∏è Trim & cut via prompts  
- üìù Add text overlays & subtitles  
- üéµ Add music, transitions, and effects  
- ‚ö° Simulated AI-agent experience (no real agent yet)

---

## Demo Scope

This is an early demo of Wands ‚Äî it does **not include** the autonomous AI agent yet.  
Instead, it simulates how a user would interact with Wands through prompts, offering a preview of the experience:

> ‚ÄúZoom in at 0:15, add subtitles, and background music‚Äù ‚Üí Result in seconds.

The goal is to validate:
- The interaction model (prompt ‚Üí edit)
- UX design for AI-first editing
- Value for creators stuck in manual workflows

---

## Vision

Video editing is slow, manual, and painful for most creators.  
Wands is building a future where creators describe the edit ‚Äî and the agent does the rest.

- Edit with natural language  
- Automatically plan and apply cuts, effects, music  
- Save 90% of editing time  
- Focus on creativity, not timelines

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion  
- **Media**: FFmpeg (for future versions)  
- **Infra (planned)**: AI agents with multimodal planning + local rendering pipelines
