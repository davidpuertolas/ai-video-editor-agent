cd wands-demo

```

---

---

## Demo Scope

This is an public demo of Wands ‚Äî it does **not include** the autonomous AI agent (that is privateüòú).  
Instead, it simulates how a user would interact with Wands through prompts, offering a preview of the experience:

Chat Mode (real implementation):
> ‚ÄúAt 0:15, add subtitles, and background music‚Äù ‚Üí Result in seconds.
> ‚ÄúAt 0:15, add text "HELLO" in red‚Äù ‚Üí Result in seconds.
> ‚ÄúAt 0:15, add background music‚Äù ‚Üí Result in seconds.

Agent Mode (implementation by sequential chat mode assignments):
> ‚ÄúAt 0:15, add subtitles, text "HELLO" in red and background music‚Äù ‚Üí Result in seconds, by simulation due to public version restrictions.

## Vision

Video editing is slow, manual, and painful for most creators.  
Wands is building a future where creators describe the edit ‚Äî and the agent does the rest.

- Edit with natural language  
- Automatically plan and apply cuts, effects, music  
- Save 90% of editing time  
- Focus on creativity, not timelines

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion...  
- **Media**: FFmpeg + private logic
- **Infra (private)**: AI agents with multimodal planning + local rendering pipelines
